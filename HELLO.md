# WHAT IS THIS?

Hi Diogo - I saw you filed two feature proposals in Atlantis and wanted to reach out. I am building Digger, a new open-source alternative. The main idea is to re-use existing CI compute instead of effectively duplicating CI like Atlantis does by running terraform on its server. Would love to hear your thoughts on this; what in your view a tool like that needs to have. I've added you on Linkedin. Hope you don't mind this unconventional way of reaching out.
